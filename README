This project takes census data relating to qualifications, occupations and incomes and transforms it into data
relating to average and lifetime earnings of graduates, as well as the most common qualifications and occupations.

The R codes, numbered according to order, are found in the Rbooks folder.

Further documentation is found in the two Word (.docx) files.
